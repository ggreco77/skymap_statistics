# skymap_statistics
simple module and exectutables to quantify skymaps and compare them. Also contains plotting and visualization routines, as well as a script that builds friendly html documents summarizing this information (intended to be used with GraceDb).

The module structure has been updated significantly to avoid duplicate code as much as possible. This has been tested somewhat and passed for the most part, but further work may be needed. In particular, we have yet to write the html documents or structure that concretely, which will require attention.
